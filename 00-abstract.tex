Random Number Generators are a critical part in cryptographic algorithms as well as financial simulations, in which lack of randomness results in inaccurate results which can cause very high costs. Thus test suites to evaluate the randomness of such generators are critical.

One of the most widely used such suites is Testu01. It provides a wide variety of tests and a very well defined specification for use with software generators. However, it lacks in speed, as the tests are run in sequence, not utilising the capabilities of modern multi-core processors.

This lack of scaling becomes apparent in the larger test suites, whose run time lies in the order of hours. This project is an attempt to parallelise the three common suites of Testu01, smallCrush, Crush and BigCrush, and compare the performance of the different implementations.
